JEGenImplant
============
A script named `jegenimplant.sh` is generated by
[`quickstart.sh`](./quickstart.sh) and put into `$HOME/jec2/bin` to make it a
little less annoying to build new implants.

New implants can be built for other operating systems and architectures by
specifying them in the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables, like

```sh
GOOS=freebsd GOARCH=arm64 /home/stuart/jec2/bin/jegenimplant.sh
```

Rebuilding
----------
The script [`cmd/ibgen.sh`](../cmd/igen.sh) included in the sourcecode can be
used to regenerate JEGenImplant but it's not particularly user-friendly.  It's
probably easier to copy jegenimplant and edit the baked-in config.
